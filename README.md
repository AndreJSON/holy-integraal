# The Quest for the Holy Integraal
The Quest for the Holy Integraal is a game created by me as a part of the course DD2387 at KTH. The game is purely made up of text and contains a lot of references to other works of fiction as well as historical figures. It was created under certain constraints and some implementation details may therefore be questionable.
