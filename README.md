# The Quest for the Holy Integraal
The Quest for the Holy Integraal is a game created by me as a part of the course DD2387 at KTH. The game is purely made up of text and contains a lot of references to other works of fiction as well as historical figures. It was created under certain constraints and some implementation details may therefore be questionable.

## An introducing text from within the game
```
A long time ago in a galaly far, far away...
On a planet, where power is measured solely through IQ and a
mathematical publication is the most prestigeuos accomplishment.
A decade long civil war has been fought between the two noble
houses Leibniz and Newton. The reason for the horrible war is
a dispute regarding who the rightful publisher of calculus is.
The only thing that could stop this calamity and unite the
people is if a new, considerably smarter man would come along.
But the only way to get an IQ of that magnitude would be to drink
from the artifact that has since long fallen in to oblivion, the
very same artifact that raised Gauss to his divine status.
The Holy Integraal.
